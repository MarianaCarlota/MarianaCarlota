### Hi there 👋 Welcome to my github page!

My name is Mariana and I have been working in fashion 👗 for most of my career. Currently I'm transitioning into a new career path in **_web development_** 💻 
I'm very curious 👀 always looking for learning new things and very excited about the future. 
These characteristics of mine, along with my interest in aesthetic and beautiful things made me jump into a new challenge - a web development bootcamp **@Le Wagon**
where I acquired new skills and built exciting projects 🚀 
Now that it's finished, I'm ready to start a new adventure in the tech world.

During this amazing experience I had the opportunity, together with my team of incredible people to build the two following projects:

  - [Rentart (airbnb clone)](https://github.com/wJoenn/rentart) - _platform for renting pieces of art_

  - [Artify](https://github.com/wJoenn/artify) - _Website designed for mobile with Ruby on Rails where it is possible to take a picture of a monument or landmark anywhere in the world and get information about it_

🔭 Currently I'm focused on improving the skills I learned in the Bootcamp and become a RoR master 💪
